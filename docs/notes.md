- [x] fix/preferTernaryOperator-JS-D009 @96b70e8 PR#6

## Ideas

- see if you can unify playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) with promptUserComputerValues()
  - As one has to use multiple lines of code to bring in the returns of each functions you
  - although right now to me it seems that it knows them separate and cleaner.
  - I think it would be better to have one function that returns the values of both the player and computer
  - If this is incorrect then what would be a better solution?
- keep naming conventions sme across all variables. either choose user or player
